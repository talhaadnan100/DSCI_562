# Lecture 7: Mixed Effects Models

## Announcements

- Lec 7 and 8 swapped.
	- Should make lab easier to do.
	- Should align better with DSCI 553.

## Agenda

- Discussion/recap: Proportional odds and proportional hazards compared with lm and glm's
- Baseball Case Study: Fit two lm's: pooled and separate.
- Discussion: mixed effects models
    1. Re-writing the model function based on individuals.
    2. Introduce the idea behind random effects.
- Baseball Case Study: Fit a LME model.

## Lecture Learning Objectives

(to be updated based on what we actually cover)

- Identify how and describe why various ways of modelling groups influences bias and variance of regression coefficients.
- Fit a mixed effects model in R, and extract various estimates:
    - Fixed effect estimates
    - Variances of the random effects
    - Regression coefficients for individuals, and for the population
- Write out the model assumptions when random effects are involved.

## Concepts

TBD
