# DSCI 562: Regression II

Approaches when faced with special conditions in regression, and consequences of ignoring these conditions.

Check out the [About](about.md) page for a description of the course.


## Course Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

- Describe the risk and value of making parametric assumptions in regression.
- Fit model functions that represent probabilistic quantities besides the mean.
- Identify situations where standard linear regression is sub-optimal, and apply alternative regression methods that better address the situation.
- Link the bias-variance tradeoff to the fundamental tradeoff of machine learning.

	- Non-technical explanation of survival analysis, with a nice succinct summary along the side of each page.
	- Recommends epidemiological background, but we will avoid those parts.
